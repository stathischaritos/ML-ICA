Machine Learning : Independent Component Analysis
=================================================
This is part of an assignment for the course Machine Learning Principles and Methods at UvA 2013

The full description of the assignment can be found at Lab1ICA.pdf or at the lab1.ipynb file which needs ipython installed to view it.
The whole project needs to be done in ipython but it would be nice to also make it as a simple python project for future usage.

For now i ve completed 1.1 and 1.2 of the assignment.

Assignment Description:
-----------------------
Machine Learning: Principles and Methods, November 2013

-	The lab exercises should be made in groups of three people, or at least two people.
-	The deadline is Sunday, Nov 10, 23:59.
-	Assignment should be sent to T.S.Cohen at uva dot nl (Taco Cohen). The subject line of your email should be
	"[MLPM2013] lab#_lastname1_lastname2_lastname3".
-	Put your and your teammates' names in the body of the email
-	Attach the .IPYNB (IPython Notebook) file containing your code and answers. Naming of the file follows the same
	rule as the subject line. For example, if the subject line is "[MLPM2013] lab01_Kingma_Hu", the attached file should
	be "lab01_Kingma_Hu.ipynb". Only use underscores ("_") to connect names, otherwise the files cannot be parsed.


Notes on implementation:
------------------------

-	You should write your code and answers in an IPython Notebook: http://ipython.org/notebook.html. If you have problems, please contact us.
-	Among the first lines of your notebook should be "%pylab inline". This imports all required modules, and your plots will appear inline.
-	NOTE: test your code and make sure we can run your notebook / scripts!

Literature
----------

In this assignment, we will implement the Independent Component Analysis algorithm as described in chapter 34 of David
MacKay's book "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms", which is freely available here:
